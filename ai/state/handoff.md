# Current Focus

The main unfinished engineering work still relates to **WP5 selective / lazy materialization**, but the remaining work is now measurement-oriented rather than core builder plumbing.

Relevant reference:

# Open Questions

- Should documentation examples reference version `1.0.0` instead of `1.3.0`?
- Should doc-consistency tooling detect version drift?
- Are the new computed-field-plus-single-join selective paths worth tightening into benchmark thresholds after hotspot reruns?
- Should the remaining WP5 fallbacks for explicit rule groups or multi-join shapes be left as the stable stopping point?
